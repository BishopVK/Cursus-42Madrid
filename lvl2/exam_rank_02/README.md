## Exam Rank 02

The rank 02 exam consists of 4 exercises with 4 different levels of difficulty, each one more challenging than the previous one. For each level of difficulty, there is a large number of possible exercises, one of which is randomly assigned to you. Until you successfully complete an exercise, the next exercise will not be available.


## Instruction set


To pass the exam, you must successfully complete all 4 exercises. In other words, the only way to pass the exam is to score 100 out of 100 points. The procedure of the exam is as follows:

| **#** | **Instruction**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `1`  | **Duration:** You have a maximum of 3 hours to complete the exam. |
|  `2`  | **Access to the repository:** Upon successfully logging in, you will have access to a repository where you must create a directory and upload exclusively the files for each exercise. |
|  `3`  | **Access to the subject:** When you start or pass an exercise, you will find the subject available in the "subject" folder, containing the exercise statement and its rules. |
|  `4`  | **Grademe:** After completing and uploading the exercise to the correct directory in the repository, you must type the keyword "grademe". The exercise will be analyzed, and if correct, you will pass the level and receive 25 points. This will unlock the next level with its respective exercise, which you must repeat the procedure for. |
|  `5`  | **Completion of the exam:** The exam ends when you finish all 4 exercises and achieve a score of 100. Otherwise, the exam will be considered failed. |
