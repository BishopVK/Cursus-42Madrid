## Exam Rank 05

This exam consists of **three consecutive exercises**, focused on **Object-Oriented Programming in C++**. The student is expected to apply modern C++ design principles such as the *Coplien's form*, use of abstract classes, inheritance, and dynamic object management.

The purpose of the exam is to evaluate the student's ability to design and implement object-oriented systems using proper encapsulation, polymorphism, and safe memory handling.

Each exercise builds upon the previous one, forming a progressively more complex project.

|------:|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `1`  | [**cpp_module_00**](./cpp_module_00/README.md) | Basic implementation of a `Warlock` class with private attributes, getters/setters, and copy restrictions, following the Coplien form. |
| `2`  | [**cpp_module_01**](./cpp_module_01/README.md) | Introduction of abstract classes `ASpell` and `ATarget`, including cloning, spell casting, and interaction between the Warlock and targets. |
| `3`  | [**cpp_module_02**](./cpp_module_02/README.md) | New spells and targets are added. `SpellBook` and `TargetGenerator` classes are introduced to manage spells and target types dynamically. |
