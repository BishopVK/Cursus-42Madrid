## CPP Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

This module covers subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++.

### Exercises

* **Exercise 00: Polymorphism**

    * This exercise introduces polymorphism by creating a base class `Animal` and derived classes like `Dog` and `Cat`.
    * It likely involves virtual functions to achieve polymorphic behavior.
* **Exercise 01: I don't want to set the world on fire**

    * This exercise probably expands on the previous one, adding more complexity to the class hierarchy or introducing new polymorphic interactions. It includes the use of a `Brain` class.
* **Exercise 02: Abstract class**

    * This exercise focuses on abstract classes, likely requiring the creation of an abstract base class and concrete derived classes that implement its pure virtual functions.
* **Extra: Exercise 03: Interface & recap**

    * This exercise emphasizes interfaces (implemented using pure abstract classes) and may involve a more comprehensive application of the concepts learned in the module. It seems to involve `AMateria`, `Character` and `ICharacter` classes.

### General Rules

* Code is compiled with `c++` and flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
* Code must compile with the `-std=c++98` flag.
* Class names are in UpperCamelCase.
* Output messages end with a newline character.
* The C++ standard library is allowed, but external libraries and certain C functions are forbidden.
