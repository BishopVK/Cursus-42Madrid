## CPP Module 00: Basic C++ Concepts

This module introduces fundamental C++ concepts, including namespaces, classes, member functions, I/O streams, initialization lists, `static`, `const`, and other basic elements of the language.

### Exercises

* **[Exercise 00: Megaphone](/lvl4/CPP_Module/CPP_Module_00/ex00)**

    * This exercise focuses on basic output manipulation.
    * The task is to create a program that takes a string as input and outputs the uppercase version of it.
    * If no arguments are provided, the program should output a default message.
    * This exercise aims to familiarize you with basic C++ syntax and input/output operations.
* **[Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook](/lvl4/CPP_Module/CPP_Module_00/ex01)**

    * This project involves creating a simple phonebook application.
    * The phonebook should allow users to add, search, and exit.
    * Adding a contact requires storing information like first name, last name, nickname, phone number, and darkest secret.
    * Searching displays contacts in a formatted list.
    * This exercise introduces basic class design and user input handling.
* **[Extra: Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams](/lvl4/CPP_Module/CPP_Module_00/ex02)**

    * This exercise likely involves a more complex scenario applying the concepts learned.
    * The specifics are not detailed in the general description.

### General Rules

* Code is compiled with `c++` and flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
* Code must compile with the `-std=c++98` flag.
* Class names are in UpperCamelCase.
* Output messages end with a newline character.
* The C++ standard library is allowed, but external libraries and certain C functions are forbidden.
