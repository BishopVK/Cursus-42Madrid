## CPP Module 01: Memory Management, Pointers, References, and Switch Statements

This module delves into memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and switch statements in C++.

### Exercises

* **[Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ](./ex00)**

    * This exercise involves creating a `Zombie` class with a `name` attribute and an `announce()` function.
    * You'll also implement functions to create zombies dynamically (`newZombie`) and on the stack (`randomChump`).
* **[Exercise 01: Moar Brainz!](./ex01)**

    * This exercise likely expands on the previous Zombie exercise, possibly involving managing multiple zombies.
* **[Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN](./ex02)**

    * This exercise focuses on understanding references by manipulating a string variable through a pointer and a reference.
* **[Exercise 03: Unnecessary Violence](./ex03)**

    * This exercise introduces interactions between classes, potentially involving a `Weapon` and `Human` classes, where humans can attack with weapons.
* **[Exercise 04: Sed is for Losers](./ex04)**

    * This exercise likely involves string manipulation, perhaps replacing parts of a string.
* **[Exercise 05: Harl 2.0](./ex05)**

    * This exercise seems to involve creating a `Harl` class that outputs specific complaints or messages at different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
* **[Extra: Exercise 06: Harl filter](./ex06)**

    * This exercise probably builds upon the previous one, adding a filtering mechanism to control which Harl messages are displayed.

### General Rules

* Code is compiled with `c++` and flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
* Code must compile with the `-std=c++98` flag.
* Class names are in UpperCamelCase.
* Output messages end with a newline character.
* The C++ standard library is allowed, but external libraries and certain C functions are forbidden.
