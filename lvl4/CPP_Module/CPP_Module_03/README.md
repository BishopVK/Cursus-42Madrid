## CPP Module 03: Inheritance

This module introduces inheritance in C++.

### Exercises

* **Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!**

    * This exercise involves creating a base class `ClapTrap` with attributes like name, hit points, energy points, and attack damage, and functions to attack, take damage, and be repaired.
* **Exercise 01: Serena, my love!**

    * This exercise likely involves creating a derived class from `ClapTrap`, such as `ScavTrap`, which inherits attributes and functions but may have its own specific behavior (e.g., `guardGate()`) and different attribute values.
* **Exercise 02: Repetitive work**

    * This exercise might involve creating another derived class from `ClapTrap` with its own unique characteristics.
* **Exercise 03: Now it's weird!**

    * This exercise could introduce multiple inheritance or more complex inheritance scenarios, possibly involving a `DiamondTrap` class.

### General Rules

* Code is compiled with `c++` and flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
* Code must compile with the `-std=c++98` flag.
* Class names are in UpperCamelCase.
* Output messages end with a newline character.
* The C++ standard library is allowed, but external libraries and certain C functions are forbidden.
