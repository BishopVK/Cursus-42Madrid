## Exam Rank 04

The exam rank 04 consists exclusively of completing one exercise: **microshell.** This exercise implements a basic shell-like command executor in C. It parses and executes commands provided as arguments, supporting command pipelines (|) and sequences (;). The built-in cd command is implemented with strict error handling. It focuses on low-level system programming using system calls like fork, pipe, execve, and chdir, with robust error management for invalid inputs or system call failures.


## Instruction set


To pass this exam, you must successfully complete the exercise. If done correctly, you will receive a score of 100 out of 100 points. The exam procedure is as follows:

| **#** | **Instruction**                                                                                                                                                         |

|  `4`  | **Grademe:** After completing and uploading the exercise to the correct directory in the repository, you must type the keyword "grademe". The exercise will be analyzed, and if correct, you will pass the level and receive 100 points. |
